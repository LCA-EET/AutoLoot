## AutoLoot Release Notes

# Report any bugs to LCAMod@danielvalle.net

# v1.1 2024-08-11
* The original auto loot item evaluation and pickup loop was refactored to address and correct a slow down that occurred when many items were on the ground.

# v1.0.3 2024-08-09
* This version patches the UI by default, for all platforms, and removes the dependency on UIUtil. If the UI cannot be patched (for example, because key portions were modified by another mod), then the pre-built UI included in the copy folder will be used.

# v1.0.2 2024-08-05
* Corrected the location of the Auto Loot options button in EET.

# v1.0.1 2024-08-05
* Removed dependency on bubb_lib.tph.

# v1.0, 2024-08-04
* Initial release; adds EET compatibility to Bubb's original auto loot mod.
* At this time, the mod is incompatible with other mods  (EET excluded) that change the game UI.
